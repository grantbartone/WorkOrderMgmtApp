## Work Order Management Project

This React app utilized React Router to navigate between the four "pages" of the app and a Work
Order Details modal accessible by clicking any Work Order listed in the Work Orders page
table, perserving forward/backward browser navigation in the process.

It also features the following:
- A scaleable file structure architecture with component-specific CSS and a common.js library for
constants and methods for app-wide reusability
- Robust tests to ensure all main pages and every Work Order Details modals render without errors
- Thorough conditional data object checking to display varying data shapes by property type
- Minimalist styling due to time constraints along with some transform animations and modal overlay
